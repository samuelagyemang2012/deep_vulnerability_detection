# deep_vulnerability_detection
Link to datasets and trained word2vec models

# Folders
data: Contains 3 folders with 3 different datasets (ast, code_gadgets, sysevr).

Word2Vec: Contains the trained Word2Vec models for each dataset with embedding sizes of 100 and 300.

Models: Contains the definition of the deep learning models (BLSTM, BGRU, HAN, YoonCNN, VANILLA), the hyper-parameters used in training, and some pre-processing functions.

graph_reports: Accuracy graphs, Loss graphs, and training report are saved in this folder.

training: Contains training scripts for each deep learning model

# How to run
1. Extract the zipped file in the link above.
2. Put the data and Word2Vec folder in the project folder. Also create a saved_models folder in project folder.
3. Select any of the training scripts in the training folder.
4. Set your hyper-parameters i.e 
EPOCHS = (default is 200. Early stopping callback is used to determing the right number of training epochs),
BATCH_SIZE
OPTIMIZER
NB: Ignore DROPOUT
5. Set the max length of sequences for each dataset, embedding size (default is 100) and training_set variable.

6. Run the script. The results (accuracy and loss graph, confusion matrix, classification report, recall, precision...etc) will saved in the graph_reports folder. eg. CG_HAN_ACC_set1.png, CG_HAN_LOSS_set1.png, CG_HAN_results_set1.txt) The trained model will be saved in the saved_models folder created.
